        <h2>A personal view on Tuya Street, written by Wen Wei, a local artist that lives in Chongqing, China</h2>
        <p>Because of my schooling, I came to Chongqing in September 2013. It was the first time I had seen this graffiti street in the Huangjueping area. By the time I wrote this article, I have lived on this street for more than five years. Interestingly, I started as a student and gradually became a resident. Every time I see tourists, I have an inexplicable sense of superiority of being a local.</p>
        <p>Huangjueping Street, also known as Tuya Street (Tuya means graffiti in Chinese), is the main street in this area of Huangjueping. In the early 1950s, the construction of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway was gradually developed through this area. Transportation convenience had emerged in various industries, creating employment opportunities. With the increase of the population, the corresponding supporting facilities such as hospitals and schools were gradually improved, thus forming a city community based on an industrial system. Conversely, the development of modern transportation and the completion of more and more efficient railway stations, the traffic advantages in Huangjueping has gradually faded away, becoming a typical model of not adapting to the needs of modernization. Also, the lack of long-term, comprehensive management in the community resulted in dirty, chaotic, and deprived circumstances, which contributed to the birth of Tuya Street. In 2007, the government of Jiulongpo District began to transform Huangjueping Street, aiming to visually change the area of Huangjueping into an artistic and culturally creative community. The reason why Huangjueping should be built into a community of art and culture rather than a community of commerce, science, and, technology is that Huangjueping is the cradle of artists in the Sichuan Fine Arts Institute. The Sichuan Fine Arts Institute was founded in 1940 and has a close relationship with the area of Huangjueping. If the industry brought material changes to Huangjueping, then Sichuan Fine Arts Institute brought spiritual nourishment. Sichuan Fine Arts Institute plays an important role here. Therefore, the government entrusted the project to the Sichuan Fine Arts Institute. Finally, Mr. Zhou Zongkai, a teacher at the Academy, led the student team to actualize the plan of Tuya Street.</p>
        <p>Tuya Street is about 1.25 kilometers long, covering the walls of schools, hospitals, shops and residential buildings along the road. Graffiti can be seen everywhere, in high and low places; the visual effect is quite amazing. A friend who experienced the Tuya Street transformation period told me that it was quite spectacular when it first got created. Scaffoldings were built along with the buildings, and over 800 people participated in the whole project, including college teachers and students, artists who lived in the local area and construction workers. It is worth mentioning that genuine graffiti culture means the marginal culture in the Chinese social context, which is equivalent to "painting on wall" in the eyes of the public. Some of the patterns on Tuya Street were designed beforehand, and some were created freely by students on the spot. These students' creations are mostly influenced by foreign graffiti culture at that time. Therefore, most of the graffiti contain English letters or words. In this context, the English letters/words themselves are no longer what they are supposed to mean, but have become a symbol, representing the students' rebellious and fresh vitality. After more than five months of working, Tuya Street was complete and had an official opening in July 2007.</p>
        <p>Patrick Cooper first came to Tuya Street two years earlier than I did. In 2011, he and his family were traveling through Asia for six months. While he visited China, he went to meet a friend from Amsterdam who was teaching graphic design in Chongqing. It was this friend that told him he should go and see Tuya street. When he first saw the street, he couldn't believe what he saw: the scale of it was so overwhelming. That day he made many pictures there and a month later when he returned to Holland, he looked at the pictures taken there and realized that he photographed something out of the ordinary. It was then that he decided to go back to make a photo reportage about this amazing, yet internationally unknown street in Chongqing.</p>
        <p>In 2012, Patrick returned to Tuya Street and began a new round of photographing. Compared with the first shooting, this time his goal was more apparent. He focused on the interplay of architecture and graffiti. It is very ironically exciting and lovely and even bizarre to see such a contrast between the oldness of the buildings and the newness of the graffiti. After these photo-shootings, Patrick had a better understanding of Tuya Street, and he also appreciated the visual beauty of Tuya Street. However, when he went back to Holland and looked and edited the photos he shot of Tuya Street, he wasn't entirely satisfied with it yet. He still wanted more, but he didn't have an immediate answer to what he wanted to achieve with his pictures, so the project was put on hold for some time until 2016. When he reorganized his earlier works, he regained his desire to continue with this photographic project and decided to go back again. It was then that he decided to make a photo-book of the street. He wanted to record the graffiti street as documentation of a street that was unknown in the western world.</p>
        <p>In 2016, Patrick focused on the people in Tuya Street, but it was not just simple portraits of people, but the combination of people and graffiti. In other words, the main objects in every photo must include people and graffiti. I call them the portraits of Tuya Street. Most of the local residents are middle-aged to older people who have lived here for most of their lives, where the pace of life is slow. Graffiti can be the symbol of new things, bright colors, bold and arrogant. One represents peace and simplicity, the other represents rebellion and fanaticism, but the two are particularly harmonious in Patrick's works.</p>
        <p>What Patrick didn't know at that time was that Chongqing became one of the hottest tourist cities in China in 2017 because of the influence of several movies and TV dramas. Chongqing was THE place to go to as a Chinese tourist. The vast tourist flow would pour into Chongqing on holidays, and the lively mountain city would become even more bustling. Tuya Street has naturally become a tourist hotspot due to its character. Patrick was surprised by the bustling scene of Tuya Street, where many tourists watched or stopped to take pictures in front of the graffiti walls. This sudden invasion of Chinese tourists made him aware that when publishing a book about Tuya street, it should also be published in China.</p>
        <p>One of Patrick's works impressed me deeply. On a tall graffiti-covered building wall, vines grew and occupied half of the wall. It is an invasion of the natural landscape into the human-made landscape (or nature attempts to recapture the living space), which was gentle, quiet, or even trying to integrate into it and coexist harmoniously with it. On the contrary, the invasion of human to man-made landscape, which is the invasion of tourists to Tuya Street, is rough and tumultuous: tourists infest Tuya Street. However, they don't have any other relation to the street beside using the graffiti as a background for the so-called cool social networking photos, which is only to satisfy their vanity. Patrick took more portraits of Tuya Street: compared with residents, the delicate visitors, standing in front of graffiti, are there for making selfies non-stop. It seems as if once they relax a little, they will lose points on their social network!</p>
        <p>Besides, this kind of invasion of tourists has brought other changes. A friend once asked me if Tuya Street was more alife before. I replied to her after thinking for a while, "Yes, and no." She then asked me why. I don't really know the specific reason, but I answered her subjectively, "In the past, this street belonged to the people who lived, studied and worked here, and everybody was at ease. However, now it's different. Tourists come and keep coming. This street is not private to residents anymore; it belongs to people; whoever comes here." Indeed, Tuya street is changing. The street has been "modernized" by the government, which made the busy night market disappear, the restaurant tables and chairs on the street disappear, and finally the entire graffiti street looks neat and orderly, dignified and solemn. Tuya Street is transforming from a public space for a small group of local people to a public space for a large group of social media fanatics. Graffiti artists can't make any graffiti during the day, because the neighborhood committee may not accept the graffiti they want to create. So they do it at night, secretly; while tourists are using various marker pens or even spraying paint, layering their signatures or other whatever-they-want things on the wherever-they-want wall.</p>
        <p>By the time when Patrick came again in 2018, the enthusiasm to Tuya Street had not subsided. The condition of this street has turned out worse(for me). The word of Tuya Street, a noun(you can see graffiti), is changing into a verb(you can do graffiti): the walls that tourists can reach are covered by all kinds of things - buzzwords, heart-shaped, singers or movie stars' names and so on. They even paint on the ground! The spray paintings made by tourists now cover some of the original graffiti of Tuya Street. The strict rules among graffiti artists; that you will not overspray a piece unless it is an improvement are ignored in this street. The one thing that makes the graffiti artists the most upset is that the real graffiti artworks are considered as nonsense and illegal by the city; however, the actual rubbish painted by the tourist are legally OK.</p>
        <p>What do the permanent residents think of this situation? In the spirit of curiosity, I used everyday conversation to answer the question, "what is your opinion about the changing of Tuya Street?" I simply talked to several residents of different occupations - a convenience store owner, a retired, old man, and a "bangbang" (coolie laborers) to find out their views. The convenience store owner answered, "How this street changes has no effect on me, so I don't have any opinions, it doesn't matter." Although I was surprised at her attitude toward the street. She is physically close to the street, but she is very far from it mentally. Well, it was expected that this was the case. Chinese people are accustomed to the way of dealing with things that don't concern themselves. As long as the situation doesn't involve their own interests, they can measure the relationship between things and themselves by "it doesn't effect to me, so no comment ". I guessed the retired old man would have the same attitude, but the frequent use of spray paint by tourists has affected his living environment, and he showed great dissatisfaction: "Smelling those spray paint every time I walk by makes my headache, I do not want them to use spray paint everywhere, or paint everywhere!" As for the "bangbang", he had been complaining about poor business on this street recently. He said that the number of the people on this street did not seem to decrease, but many old customers left because of the relocation of Sichuan Fine Arts Institute, and tourists did not bring any business. Although he did not answer my question directly, it is not difficult to see from his experience that the change of Tuya Street seems to be slowly overwhelming their way of life, and many "bangbang" have left to make a living elsewhere. This also points out the fact that the social ecosystem of this area has changed because of the changes of Tuya Street.</p>
        <p>Finally, in 2018 when Patrick visited Tuya street yet again something happened to the street that was less surprising than the invasion of the crowds of tourists; some parts of Tuya street were to be demolished. Although he heard that Tuya street was facing demolition back to 2016, once things are on the brink of action, the psychological preparation he had made still could not defeat the feelings of loss. Once things got to this point, I felt that Tuya Street is not just a simple thing for Patrick. It became a person, a foreign friend who he met regularly every year. If Tuya Street is a person for me, it must be my roommate who has lived with me for many years. I am so familiar with him or her that I ignored many details and naturally did not his or her changes. For tourists, Tuya Street is a stranger, they only see his or her appearance; for Patrick, as mentioned above, he has been a very good friend with Tuya Street. He knows his friend so well that he can see the change in his friend immediately, once they meet. Every time they met, he would eagerly and carefully observe and document it. Regularly returning to photograph the street was his way of keeping a record, thousands of images became his narrative language to show you this amazing street, through this photobook.</p>
        <p>One day, as I was walking along the street with my friends, one friend suddenly stopped me and pointed to the huge poster on the wall and said, "Look!" I had never noticed anything on that wall, but when I saw the poster I didn't even know it had been hung, it was a weird feeling in my heart. The poster shows the future of Huangjueping, an upscale district, a harmonious and prosperous scene. It is written in the words of propaganda: "Creating an Art and Culture Community of Huangjueping ". Due of this, the thought in my mind is that the house value of Tuya Street will rise in the future, because the new generation of people with abundant materials need to seek a cultural identity, that is such a community of art and culture combined with living is ideal. Ironically, people always say that culture is the most important thing, but when thing comes to reality, for example, land expropriation, demolition, rectification and development, politics and economy are always the most important. As for culture? I am afraid that is just a pretty statement, nothing more.</p>
        <p>To continue the discussion, "Will Huangjueping become like this in the future?", my friend asked.</p>
        <p>I shrugged and answered helplessly, "Probably."</p>
        <p>"What abourt Tuya Street?"</p>
        <p>"Well, you will never know."</p>
